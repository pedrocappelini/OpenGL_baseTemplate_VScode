# OpenGL Base Template for VSCode (C++)

This repository provides a base template for setting up OpenGL projects in Visual Studio Code using C++.

- **Compilation**: Use `Ctrl + Shift + B` to compile the project. This will create an executable from `main.cpp`. It will be placed on the build folder and runned automatically.

*I don't understand half the things I did here, but it worked. Apparently.*
