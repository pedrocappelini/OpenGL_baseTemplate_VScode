# OpenGL Base Template for VSCode (C++)

This repository provides a base template for setting up OpenGL projects in Visual Studio Code using C++.

- **Compilation**: Use `Ctrl + Shift + B` to compile the project. This will create an executable from `main.cpp`.The .exe will be on the build folder an will run atuomatically after compiling.
(You still need to download yourself all the stuff for running c++ on vscode)

*I don't understand half the things I did here, but it worked. Apparently.*
